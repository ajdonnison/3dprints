### bearing-blank.scad

Simple blank for a typical skateboard wheel bearing, used to mock up other designs that use these.

### collect.scad

When using a 1/4" bolt for the reel adapter, provides a secure connection to the bearing

### feeder.scad

Feeder/waterer for small animals.  Designed to be hung from wire mesh.  The default values match half-inch (13mm) square mesh and provide enough food for 4 adult chickens.

### funnel_closer.scad

See funnel.scad, this is just the closer as I kept breaking it.

### funnel.scad

Drygoods measuring and dispensing funnel.  With the slide closed it can be used to measure drygoods (holds around 1.5 cups), the slide can then be opened to dispense into a bottle or similar container.

Developed to enable the dispensing of milk powder into a bottle.  Then just add water!

### gasket.scad

Really, really simple gasket, meant to be printed in flexible material.  If you need it compressible you probably want to set the infill very low.

### holster.scad

Got one of those handy trigger-style hose guns that have a rotating pattern selector on the front?  Sick and tired of trying to find somewhere to hang it out of the way without either breaking the trigger or spraying yourself in the face?

This handy holster can be cable-tied to a wire mesh fence or screwed onto a wall or fence post and fits one of the more common varieties of hose nozzles in Australia.  Can be easily adapted to other sizes.

### rattrap1.scad

Yes, there are likely to be more.  This is a set of pieces that can be added to a standard 90mm PVC downpipe so that it safely holds rat bait and is not easily displaced by inquisitive chooks.

### reel-adapter.scad

Adapts the large open side of a filaform 500g reel so it matches the other side. Mainly for use with the reel-hub and reel-holder adapters to fit these to a FlashForge Inventor series printer

### reel-holder.scad

An adjusted reel holder that replaces the one that is built into the FlashForge Inventor printer.  The advantage is that with the hub centre it can fit FlashForge, eSun and Filaform reels from 500g to 1kg.  Requires a 1/4" hex-head bolt and nut.  2 1/2" bolt will handle the 500g reel, 3" is required for the 1kg reel.

### reel-hub.scad

You need two of these and two skateboard wheel bearings to make up the reel hub assembly that is used with the above holder.  The hubs are truncated cones that match the internal width of most reels - or at least most that I've tried so far.  Each hub needs a bearing pressed into it - you may need to heat the hub first.

### spanner.scad

Simple tool to fit the hex head of the bolt used in the reel holder assembly.
